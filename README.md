## Overview

Big School is a project that aims to remove the stress of school intranet. It is a website that not only is designed for the user, but also for the wider outlook of school life. It envisions a new era of online interaction between students for Christ's College, and be so simple and intuitive that they don't even need to think about going about the design of the website.

The intranet will contain multiple accessible "areas" of school life that will gameify how we use intranet in school. For instance, if a student was to access the _Sports_ area, the things they would see are stuff such as notices, events and activities related to Sports in College. The area is also used to communicate ideas, take part in surveys, look at upcoming schedules (such as sports draws), talk to your teammates online and show news relevant to Sports at College. Photos related to sports are also found here.

This area will be completey seperate from the _Academics_ area, which will have public study notes (verified by other students), NZQA information, news, events and notices related to academics across the school, as well as a student and teacher forum to discuss questions from different classes (this would be relevant to you, instead of getting questions from a topic you aren't studying). There would also be a "Ingenuity Bar", where students can ask questions one-on-one with someone with exceptional skill in a chosen subject, or someone volunteering to lend a hand with some homework. These students will be voted in to the I.B. by members of school when they apply.

When you first load up the website, you will see your _Dashboard_. Here, you'll see your widgets for different parts of school life, such as Timetable, Grades, your Sport, Relevant to You*, the College Clock and more.

>Disclaimer: At this time, this software is in development and is being developed for a school project. This may not be continued in the future.

## Timeline

The project is on track for its completion at the end of Term 3, 2022. Every two days, I will undergo a "sprint", an efficient way of managing time on a project. Each sprint will contian feedback from the previous sprint, design changes and a report summarising what changed and what I plan to do in the next sprint.

### How to read release numbers

Version numbers are stated by: `major`.`minor`.`patch`-`release_type`
`release_type` can either have an `a` or `b`. `a` being the most final version and `b` being a pre-release (beta or alpha). These indicate the stability of each version.

**: Relevant to You is a compilation of all the events, notices and information that is relevant to you. You will only get notifications on things that you have specified.**
